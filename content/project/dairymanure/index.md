This project focused on evaluating technologies for effectiveness in decreasing methane emissions from California dairy farms. One study included technoeconomic analysis of a wide range of processing technologies with the goal of determmining the most cost-effective strategies. We also investigated the performance of field-scale solid-liquid separation technologies present on California dairy farms. We are currently investigating the effectivness of an advanced solid-liquid manure separation system, composting and pelletizing of the solids, and application of compost products to almond orchards to prommote healthy soils.
