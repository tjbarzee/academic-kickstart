I am a PhD Candidate in Biological Systems Engineering at the University of California Davis where I work with Professor Ruihong Zhang in the Bioenvironmental Engineering lab. My  research interests include: Agricultural Waste Management, Renewable Energy, Controlled Environment Engineering (e.g. Greenhouses and Bioreactors), Algal and Fungal Biotechnology, and Technoeconomic/Life Cycle Assessment. I am also passionate about engineering education, sustainable development, and interdisciplinary planetary health solutions (e.g. One Health). I am in the final stage of my doctoral degree at UC Davis and my future goal is to become a faculty researcher and educator.
