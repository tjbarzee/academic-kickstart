abstract: The dairy industry represents Californiaâ€™s largest agricultural commodity, generating $6.56 billion dollars out of a total $50 billion in agricultural production. California dairies are also large sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manure flushing and lagoon storage are common manure management practices on dairies. Solid-liquid separation technologies have the abilities to reduce methane emissions from lagoons by reducing the amount of volatile solids loaded into lagoons. The goal of this study was to quantify the potential reduction of methane emissions from lagoons by using various solid-liquid separation technologies and to determine the cost implications for deploying these separation technologies on dairies.
