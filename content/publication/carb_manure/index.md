abstract: The	objective	of	this	research	project	is	to	develop	information	to	help	inform	policies	to	
promote	reduction	of	greenhouse	gas	(GHG)	emissions	from	dairy	manure	management	in	
California.		This	research	(1)	describes	and	evaluates	manure	management	technology	
options	currently	or	potentially	available	to	dairy	farms	in	California,	(2)	compares	
technologies	based	on	GHG	emissions	reduction	potential,	costs	and	limitations,	and	(3)	
estimates	GHG	mitigation	cost	(or	supply)	curves	for	various	manure	management	
strategies	if	applied	across	large	fractions	of	the	California	dairy	industry.		Air	and	water	
quality	implications	are	discussed	based	on	limited	data	and	other	technical	studies	
available,	especially	those	focused	on	California	conditions.
