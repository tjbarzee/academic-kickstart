abstract: Cultivation of oleaginous microorganisms on wastewater provides alternative biofuel options while also acting as a remediation technique for alternative wastewater treatment. This chapter describes guidelines and methods for the production of oleaginous microorganisms—with a focus on microalgae—using wastewater as a growth medium while considering a variety of general challenges for both lab- and industrial-scale production. Cultivation techniques described here range in scale from microplates with 10-mL working volumes, up to multigallon, industrial-scale microorganism cultivation, with a focus on microalgae. This chapter includes guidelines for the preparation of wastewater and selection of oleaginous microorganisms combined with methods for the production of oleaginous microorganisms cultivated using wastewater.
